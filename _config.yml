  Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Andy, and I'm currently finishing up my MS in Marketing Analysis from DePaul University.

  I enjoy the process of uncovering insightful information within data to help companies achieve their goals. Here I featured some of my previous projects that I enjoyed working on the most.
