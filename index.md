### Advanced Data Analysis

[HR Analytics - Advanced Data Analysis with R](/pdf/HR Analytics.pdf)

The goal of this project was to predict employee attrition rate and monthly income. _Logistic Regression_ was used to predict the probability of attrition, while _Linear Regression_ was used to predict monthly income. Other statistical techniques were also applied with R to explore hidden relationships among variables.
In addition to group efforts, my individual report (responsible for both coding and the corresponding portions of technical report) is attached on page 27. The complete R code (page 40) and supplementary graphs are also attached as appendices.

_Individual Contributions_:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Ordinary Least Square
3. Correspondence Analysis
4. Lasso Regression
5. Partial Least Square

### Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

[Walmart Sales Prediction - Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with R](/pdf/Walmart Sales Prediction.pdf)

Utilize time series analysis with R to find optimal ways with which a major retail company can most accurately forecast future sales. This project includes various forecasting models, including _Simple Exponential Smoothing, Holt's Method, ARIMA, Time Series Regression,_ and more. Both _log transformation_ and _differencing_ were applied to stabilize the model performance. Lastly, the accuracy of the models was evaluated based on _RMSE_ and _MAE_. The complete R code is attached on page 15 as an appendix.

_Contributions_:
1. Group efforts throughout coding, presentation, and final report 
2. Presented the best-performed forecasting model at the final presentation

### Advanced Market Research

[Factor Analysis & Cluster Analysis](/pdf/Factor Analysis & Cluster Analysis.pdf)

Applied _Principal Component Analysis_ with SPSS to analyze survey results with 300 respondents. As for clustering the respondents based on message rating (_cluster analysis, page 23_), both hierarchical clustering (_Ward's method_) and non-hierarchical clustering (_K-means_) were applied, with a _Two-step cluster analysis_ at the end to evaluate the results.

[Discriminant Analysis](/pdf/Discriminant Analysis.pdf)

Used _Discriminant Analysis_ to identify the attribute which has the strongest discriminatory power and the strongest correlation with the discriminant function. As for classification, the discriminant function correctly classified 61.5% of the total 299 responses.
